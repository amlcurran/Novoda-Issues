### Getting started

Install Xcode (from the App Store, make sure to open it at least once!) or AppCode (Google's your friend)

Install bundler:

```
gem install bundler
```

Install dependencies in the project. Run this in the root of the project:

```
bundle install && bundle exec pod install
```

Make sure you have a personal access token from Github. Create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and don't commit it to Git!!!

Come to the kata!
